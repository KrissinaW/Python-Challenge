# Python-Challenge
Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll:

 In this challenge we are required to put the Python concepts that we learned over the past week to the test by completing two challenged that are real-world situations. 
 
**PyBank :** 
 We were given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Our mission is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**PyPoll :**
In this Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

We were be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv.
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

Our mission is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

 - The total number of votes cast
 - A complete list of candidates who received votes
 - The percentage of votes each candidate won
 - The total number of votes each candidate won
 - The winner of the election based on popular vote
